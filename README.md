A simple raytracer written in the [Nix configuration language](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/index.html). It renders to the terminal in ASCII or Unicode, but I plan to adapt it to generate actual images[^1].


[^1] ...so I have an excuse to play with performance optimizations instead of updating my resume
